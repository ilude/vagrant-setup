vagrant-setup
=============

Based off of [Bill's Kitchen](https://github.com/tknerr/bills-kitchen) by [tknerr](https://github.com/tknerr).

Many of the tools that Bill's Kitchen installs are already part of my existing tool chain 
(see: [WindowsPowerShell](https://github.com/ilude/WindowsPowerShell) for more on my tool chain environment ):
  * ConEmu
 	* SublimeText2 (with additional packages for Chef and Cucumber)
 	* Git 
 	* putty
   
And in some cases I perfer different tools that are included:
  * [Perforce Merge Tool](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools)
