vagrant-setup
=============

A [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) environment for Windows. 

Based off of [Bill's Kitchen](https://github.com/tknerr/bills-kitchen) by [tknerr](https://github.com/tknerr).

Many of the tools that Bill's Kitchen installs are already part of my existing tool chain. 
I have them customized to my liking and maintaining too seperate copies is not [fun](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2012:Losing) 
(see: [WindowsPowerShell](https://github.com/ilude/WindowsPowerShell) for more on my tool chain environment):
 * [ConEmu](https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/)
 * [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
 * [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
 * [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
   
And in some cases I perfer different tools that are included:
  * [Perforce Merge Tool](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools)

In addition changes in the latest versions of [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) have force Bill's Kitchen to remove [Veewee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee), which I rely on.
